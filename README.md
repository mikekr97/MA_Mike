This repository contains the code, data, and presentation material for my Master's thesis on **Causal Modeling with Neural Networks and Individualized Treatment Effect Estimation **. The work includes multiple experiments using both simulated and real-world clinical trial data, specifically the International Stroke Trial (IST) dataset.
