In the introduction part, my aim is to give a summary of 
important concepts of causal inference and causal models. Further, 
I motivate the importance for methods that allow to draw causal 
conclusions from observational data in contrast to randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) and that the proposed framework of tram-dags (cite sick duerr)
 can be used as such a tool. \\ 
 
In the methods section, I give a detailed description of the tram-dag framework 
and how it works by illustrating it on a simple simulated example. 
I also show for what kind of causal queries the model can be used for. 
Although it is not a topic for observations data, I discuss how the model can be 
used for estimating the individualized treatment effect (ITE).\\ 

In the results section, I will first show results from simulation studies where the 
ground truth is known. Second, I will show results on a real-world example in the
setting of climate data. Third, I present the results of the ITE estimation. \\ 

In the final section, I will discuss the results and give a conclusion about the 
advantages and limitation of this framework and provide an outlook.
