This thesis marks the final part of my Master of Science in Biostatistics at the University of Zurich. I wanted to work on a topic where I could apply my interest and deepen my knowledge in machine learning, especially in relation to causal questions.

The TRAM-DAG framework \citep{sick2025}, developed by my supervisors Prof. Dr. Beate Sick and Prof. Dr. Oliver D{\"u}rr, provided a perfect opportunity to do so. Our initial aim was to apply it to real-world data and potentially include semi-structured data. However, due to some surprising findings by \citet{chen2025}, our focus shifted towards the increasingly important topic of individualized treatment effect (ITE) estimation. Towards the end, we then bridged ITE estimation with the TRAM-DAG framework.

I want to thank my supervisors and all the people I had the chance to work and study with, as well as everyone who supported me on this journey.

% In the introduction, our aim is to give a summary of key concepts in causal inference and causal models. We also motivate the need for methods that allow drawing causal conclusions from observational data and introduce the proposed framework of TRAM-DAGs \citep{sick2025} as a tool that can be used for this purpose. We also want to highlight the importance of estimation of personalized treatment effects. \\ 
% 
% In the methods section, we give a detailed description of the TRAM-DAG framework, how it works, and for what kinds of causal queries the model can be used. Although individualized treatment effect (ITE) estimation is not a typical observational data problem, we also discuss important considerations and how TRAM-DAGs and other models can be applied in this context. \\ 
% 
% Then, we persent results of simulation studies that show the capabilities of TRAM-DAGs, the analysis of potential limitations in ITE estimation, and the TRAM-DAG applied for ITE estimation. Additionally, we perform ITE estimation on the International Stroke Trial (IST) with different causal ML methods including TRAM-DAGs.\\ 
% 
% In the final sections, we discuss the results and draw conclusions about the strengths and limitations of the framework and ITE esitimaiton in general, while also providing an outlook for future research.

This thesis investigates the use of TRAM-DAGs \citep{sick2025} as a flexible approach for estimating structural equations in known directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). TRAM-DAGs offer several advantages: the model inherently knows when to control for covariates based on the DAG, is highly customizable in terms of flexibility and interpretability, and allows sampling from observational, interventional, and counterfactual distributions. We show how to incorporate ordinal predictors, model interactions, and examine how variable scaling affects interpretability.

A main focus was the estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) using a variety of causal machine learning (ML) models. In simulation studies, we analyzed limitations in ITE estimation and found that unmeasured effect modifiers can severely impact estimation accuracy, and that the ignorability assumption alone may not ensure unbiased results -- a concern that has also been noted in prior research \citep{vegetabile2021}. The limitations found may also help explain the poor ITE estimation performance observed in the real-world application on the International Stroke Trial dataset \citep{chen2025}. We further demonstrated that TRAM-DAGs can be used for ITE estimation in relatively complex DAG structures, provided that the DAG is fully known and all variables are observed.

While promising, TRAM-DAGs require training time due to their reliance on neural networks and, when aiming for interpretability, certain assumptions about the model structure. Future work could explore applications to more real-world data, potentially including semi-structured inputs, and further investigate ITE estimation in the presence of unmeasured interactions.

This thesis contributes to the field of causal inference under observational data and to the estimation of personalized treatment effects using causal ML models.

TRAM-DAGs offer several advantages: the model knows when to adjust based on the DAG, avoids incorrect covariate adjustment, and allows sampling from observational, interventional, and counterfactual distributions. Their ability to combine interpretability with flexibility makes them well suited for practical use.
